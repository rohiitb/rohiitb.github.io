Hello there! Thank you for visiting my website. I'm thrilled to share that I recently completed my Master's degree in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, I am actively seeking job opportunities in the field of computer vision and motion planning. Please feel free to contact me with relevant roles via email.

In my professional career, I have worked as an integration lead at [SkyMul](https://skymul.com/) (based in Atlanta) and developed end-to-end software pipelines to semalessly integrate with their quadrupedal hardware platform. I have extensively worked with ROS. Before joining Penn, I also worked on feature development for mobile robots for [Mowito](https://www.mowito.in/) which is a robotics startup based out of India. 

My passion lies in the holistic development of autonomous mobile robots. I aim to build robust software pipelines that can seamlessly integrate with specific hardware requirements. If you would like to learn more about my qualifications and experience, please find my resume [here](https://divyanshurs.github.io/files/Resume.pdf). 

Research Experience
======

mLAB- Autonomous Go-Kart Group | GRASP-UPenn
------

Latest Update:- UPenn are the WINNERS of the Autonomous go-kart challenge hosted at Purdue University!!!

Throughout my active participation in this competition for two semesters, I acquired valuable experience in the implementation of both reactive and pre-mapping based controls. This practical engagement enabled me to apply the theoretical concepts I learned during my studies at UPenn, effectively reshaping and putting them into practice. Furthermore, my proficiency in developing software pipelines and leveraging the capabilities of the Robot Operating System (ROS) proved to be advantageous in this context.

The competition itself was divided into two distinct parts. In the first phase, our objective was to navigate the track without relying on a pre-mapped path, instead adopting a reactive-based approach to control the autonomous go-kart. Our goal was to react to the observed track in real-time, ensuring safe operation throughout five laps to secure victory. To achieve this, we decided to leverage the power of image-based grass detection using a single monocular camera. By transforming the camera's image into a pre-calibrated bird's eye view and adjusting depth measurements on a per-pixel basis, we were able to obtain an extremely reliable lane detection capability. These detections were then converted into a Laser Scan format, which served as input for our gap-follow algorithm. Our approach demonstrated solid performance, especially under favorable lighting conditions. You can watch the back-end visualization of our algorithm and the actual run below.

In the second part of the competition, our team was tasked with implementing pre-mapping based controls.To secure a victory in this coategory, the requirement was to complete a total of five laps within the shortest possible time. My specific responsibility involved the development of a lightweight Python library capable of fusing data from multiple sensors, such as GPS, IMU, and Wheel Odometry, using a partial state update. You may be wondering why we opted to create a separate library instead of utilizing existing open-source options. It's a valid question, and initially, we started the project by leveraging the well-known Robot Localization library in ROS. However, upon careful consideration, we determined that using this library would be excessive for our specific requirements. Taking inspiration from its approach, I devised a partial update scheme for the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm, which proved to be highly effective for our needs.

To integrate this localization approach with the pure-pursuit algorithm, we established pre-mapping pipelines. Initially, we manually drove the go-kart, collecting waypoints along the track using our sensor fusion system. These collected waypoints served as the foundation for creating a path that the pure-pursuit algorithm would follow. We employed a simple linear interpolation scheme to generate a smooth and accurate trajectory for the pure-pursuit algorithm to track. I invite you to watch our winning pure-pursuit run in the competition below.

The following is the final result of EKF fusion using GPS and IMU. The pipeline consists of first filtering out GPS jumps and then using an EKF to fuse GPS positions with IMU measurements. The results below show the filtered results on the upper left hand side, the fused covariance on the lower left hand side. The raw data of the GPS and its covariance are shown on the top and bottom right respectively.

As part of exploring alternate approaches for future competitions, I am currently working on fusing cone detections from both LIDAR and camera sensors. This ongoing project involves various stages, including calibration and the development of separate cone detection pipelines. We have also implemented an overlay of camera detections using YOLO-v7 to filter the point cloud data. Our ultimate objective is to utilize this robust and fused pipeline to perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using cones as landmarks. I invite you to have a look at the current results below.

Professional Experience
======

Skymul (Atlanta) - **Integration Lead**
------

My role at Skymul had been to integrate hardware components and create an end-to-end software pipeline for performing waypoint navigation on a mobile platform. During the period of my internship, I've had the opportunity to interact with hardware and learn how to use software drivers to integrate them into a complete system. I worked mainly on integrating three different hardware platforms with the robot. The aim was to test the accuracy of these sensor platforms and decide the best for the robotâ€™s task at hand. 

Mowito Robotics (Bangalore) - **Robotics Engineer**
------

My work was majorly focused on feature development of this controller for client-specific applications of mobile robots (results of this work are shown below). I was also involved in porting the Maxl controller to ROS2 for benchmarking and making the Maxl controller library independent of ROS.

<!-- Trajectory optimization for cube manipulation
------
The objective of this project, completed as part of the MEAM 517 course, was to design control systems for the vertices of a polytope (a cube in this case) to enable precise movement to a desired position and orientation. The main challenges encountered were managing surface friction and the number of contacts the cube had at any given moment.

We implemented two methods namely the offline iLQR and online MPC approach to achieve this task. The results of which are given below.

SLAM using Particle Filter for humanoid Robot
------
The aim of this project was to perform particle filter based SLAM using the IMU and the LIDAR data from a THOR-OP Humanoid Robot. The IMU data avaialble was filtered and used with lidar data to perform SLAM. The lidar data is transformed into the map co-ordinates by applying suitable transformations. Based on the paricle filter approach the best particle with maximum correlation is chosen and the log odds of the map is updated. This scan-matching technique is used to update the obstacles in real-time on a gridmap as well as localize the robot in the world.

<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
